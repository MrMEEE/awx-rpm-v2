This is something that I just haven't gotten around to describing.. So I might need some feedback.. Please tell me if you hit any issues:

I have created a bootstrap script.. use it if you will, or implement manually

https://github.com/MrMEEE/awx-rpm-v2/blob/main/docs/bootstrap-build.sh

from there, use the changeversion script to change into the version you want to build:

./changeversion 24.6.1

This uses the spec files that I have created..

From here, run getsources, to fetch the source code for the python packages:

./getsources

Now that you have the sources, build the source RPMS:

./buildsrc

Now you should be ready to build all the dependencies.. run the mockbuilds:

./mockbuild

This will take quite a while.. 

You can check status with:

./checkbuilds

and get hints to fixing errors with:

./geterrors

when you have all the dependencies built, you have to build receptor

./generate-and-build-receptor-source <VERSION>

I have had issues build 1.4.8.. so go with 1.4.7 (or find the issue)

When receptor is built, it's finally time for generate the AWX-RPM SRPM:

./generate-awx-source

and then build it with single-mockbuild

Hope it makes sense..
