* Generate New AWX-RPM version from a former version

Run the movetoversion script: /opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/movetoversion <existing version> <new version>

This will take the changes from the old version and try to apply it to the new..

Look for patches that couldn't be applied:

ls -la /opt/awx-rpm-v2/versions/deps/*.rej

and fix them manually..

Then run:

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/buildsrc force

to make sure that all SRPMs have been built

now run

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/mockbuild

and get ready to wait.. 

Mockbuild will keep interating over all unbuild packages, as long as it gets some packages built.. (due to dependencies between packages)

When all dependencies have been build, go to: https://github.com/ansible/receptor and look for the newest release number (as of writing, 1.4.3)

Then run:

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/generate-and-build-receptor-source {recepter version}

eg.

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/generate-and-build-receptor-source 1.4.3

This will fetch source code and build receptor..

When built succesful, run

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/generate-awx-source

This will generate the source and SRPM for awx-rpm..

to regenerate the SRPM, without generating the source, run:

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/generate-awx-source nosource

Every run of "generate-awx-source", will increment the build number..

to build the RPM:

/opt/awx-rpm-v2/new-scripts/single-mockbuild awx-rpm-23.6.0-2.el9.src.rpm
